    "In this course,   We will introduce some tools and capabilities in Python that will let us write more robust, scalable and maintainable software applications.  We will introduce topics in software engineering and explore solutions using Python.  \n",

    "<h3> Software Engineering and Design Patterns. </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Software engineering is a discipline in Computer Science that deals with the ability to architect software solutions to complex problems that occur in a wide variety of fields such as\n",
    "\n",
    "- Operating System Design\n",
    "- Enterprise Applications\n",
    "- Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning\n",
    "- Embedded Systems\n",
    "- Big Data Systems\n",
    "- Scientific Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "and many others.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Why is software engineering so important?  Let's take a look at a graphic that shows a history of applications, specifically the amount of code that was needed to create the application. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a href = http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/million-lines-of-code/> Codebases </a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the work it would take, not only to write the software, but to manage the project teams and to architect these solutions to make them as efficient and reliable as possible.  This is where the software engineer adds his value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Often, software engineers have to deal with not only the software itself, but with the challenge of managing multiple development teams, often scattered across the globe, as well as with project management and the difficulty of meeting often arbitrary deadlines.  There are many tools and methodologies that can be used to allow the software engineer to meet these demanding goals.  We'll be looking at the concept of *design patterns* as one of the tools in the software engineers toolbox.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This idea of design patterns has its roots in building architecture and civil engineering.   It refers to best practices when designing structures such as buildings and bridges.  This idea of design patterns is a critical component of any engineering solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this, let's take a look at some structures with both sound and flawed design patterns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first one is a well known failure of a bridge in Tacoma, Washington from 1940.  Fortunately, no people were killed during this collapse. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second one is the failure of the first Ariane-5 rocket launch by the European Space Administration (ESA) in 1994. \n",

There are occasions when you will want to use this iterator more than once.  One way to do this is to use the *tee* function.  This function is named after the tee utility in Unix.  In Unix, the tee program allows you to create two output streams, one of which will be the standard output and the other one to a file of some sort.

    "\n",
    "### A history of object oriented programming. ###\n",
    "\n",
    "The first object oriented language developed in the 1960's was SIMULA. This language was developed at the Norwiegan Computing center at Oslo, Norway. Many of the features that are common to OO languages, such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and garbage collection were first introduced in SIMULA, <br><br>\n",
    "SIMULA inspired Bjarne Stroustrup at AT&T Bell Labs to invent an OO language, C++ that was built on top of the already popular C Programming Language implementation, also invented at Bell Labs. C++ became the first widely used OO language in production. In the early 1990's, James Gosling and others at Sun Microsystems developed Java. Java was an OO language inspired by and took many features from, C++. \n",
    "Concurrently, Guido Van Rossum developed another OO Language, Python. Python is a dynamic, or scripting language that is developed from the ground up as an OO language. Python has gown in popularity and is now one of the most popular languages in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Why use Object Oriented Programming? </h3>\n",
    "1. OOP provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining abstract datatypes where implementation details are hidden and the datatype has a clearly defined interface. \n",
    "2. OOP makes it easy to maintain and modify existing code as new objects can be created with small differences to existing ones. \n",
    "3. OOP provides a good framework for code libraries where supplied software components can be easily adapted and modified by the programmer. This is particularly useful for developing graphical user interfaces. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this mean in practice? Let's consider the following example: You work as a software engineer for a large bank. You are tasked to add functionality to an existing application written in a procedural language such as C or COBOL. In order to complete this task, not only must you write the software for the new functionality, you must integrated it into the existing code base, perform regression testing to make sure that you haven't broken any existing code and you must also test that you haven't introduced new \n",
    "bugs in to the code base.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the procedural programming paradigm, this cycle can quickly devolve into a nighmarish scenario where more and more programmers spend more of their time trying to fix existing errors rather than creating new functionality and features. Additionally, without strong process controls (which most companies do not have) existing software can suffer bit rot which is a term used to describe increasingly unwieldy and buggy software applications. \n",
    "As we'll see later, OOP provides ways to solve these existing problems in a clean, well designed fashion.\n"

In Python, this constructor is called *\\_\\_new\\_\\_()*.  It is rare that a programmer will need to define his own version of the constructor.  In general, the common starting point for an object is the *\\_\\_init\\_\\_()* method.  Note that many people confuse \\_\\_init\\_\\_ with a constructor.  The init method is not a constructor, it is an initializer.  It is this method that is used to set the initial value of any instance attributes. <br>\n",

If an object's reference count goes to zero, then the object's memory will eventually be reclaimed by Python's *garbage collector*.  In general, as the programmer you will not need to worry about this unless your application is creating millions of objects.  When a Python object is garbage collected, the *\\_\\_del\\_\\_()* method will be called.

A Class is a design or representation of an object, much like the blueprint for a house or other structure. Classes show how data and functions (called methods in OO) are coupled together. Each object, if properly designed, serves one function. \n",
    "For example, a Person object may handle all relevant details of a Person, i.e. setting such data attributes as the person's name, date of birth, address and other relevant details. Objects are instantiations of a Class, much like a house is an instantiation of the blueprints. The class shows how an object is constructed. An object in memory is the result of being built according to the class specifications,. \n",
    "2. Information hiding. More commonly known as encapsulation. One of the main principles of OO is that a programmer should not need to know how an object performs its tasks, moreover the programmer using the object should not have access to the data or internal functions of the object. The object should provide a set of methods that allow the programmer to perform operations on the object's data. \n",
    "3. Inheritance. The programmer should be able to create new objects that inherit properties of another object. For instance, we discussed a Person class earlier. We should be able to create a new class, Employee, which inherits attributes from the Person class, such as the name, and date of birth, but can also add new attributes, such as an employee ID. Inheritance is one of the key properties of OOP., \n",
    "4. Interfaces. The ability to define methods and data that can be implemented by the programmer without doing so beforehand. Not all OO languages have or need this concept. Java uses interfaces extensively, however this is implemented as abstract virtual classes in C++ and Python.  Abstract Base Classes will be discussed in a later chapter.\n",
    "5. Polymorphism. This is another key concept in OOP. This allows the programmer to treat multiple subclasses as if they are the base class. For example, The programmer may have a base class, called Animal, and various inherited classes, called Cat, Dog, and Horse. Using polymorphism it is possible to treat instantiated objects of those classes as Animals. Another important use of polymorphism is in creating functions that allow us to separate implementation details from the business logic. \n"

    "<h4> Inheritance </h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a tool in object oriented programming that enables code re-use.  The concept here is that you can create a class that *inherits* attributes and methods from another class, usually called the *parent* or *base* class.  Consider the following scenario:  You work for a large bank, and you have been asked two write a class that manages customer bank accounts.  You then create a bank account class and add attributes such as account number, account holder, account holder address, etc.  As well, you create methods such as getBalance, calculateInterest and so on.  This works well, until your manager wants you to add the ability to handle both current accounts and savings accounts.  Therefore, you may well need to add methods specifically for savings accounts and current accounts in the same object.  Additionally, you will need to test for account type to make sure that you're calling the right methods for, for example calculating interest.  This problem only gets worse as your manager asks for yet more products that need support, such as credit cards, pension accounts and so on.  With inheritance, we no longer need to worry about this problem.  We can simply create a base class *BankAccount*.  From there, we can create derived classes, such as *SavingsAccount*, *CurrentAccount*, *PensionAccount* and so on. These classes all inherit common attributes and methods from the BankAccount class, but can then override them for specific reasons in their own class.  <br><br>\n",
    "In general, there are two models of inheritance that a programming language can implement.  The first is *single inheritance*. In this model, a class can only inherit from a single parent.  This is implemented in languages such as Java and C Sharp.  Other languages use a second model, called *Multiple Inheritance*.  This allows a class to inherit from many parents.  Languages such as C++ and Python use this model.  In all cases, OO languages implement an ultimate base class that all other classes are derived from by default.  In Python, this base class is simply called *object*.  In Python 2, you should declare your classes as explicitly deriving from this object base if they aren't inheriting from another class, in Python 3, this is the default behavior. \n",

    "### Design antipatterns, or, how to recognize bad software design ###\n",
    "Bad software is everywhere.  Software which is difficult or impossible to maintain or extend,  permeates society, causing untold billions of dollars in losses and can even cause death or injury. As software engineers, we must recognize these problems and find ways to design applications that lack these antipatterns.  <br><br>\n",
    "Here we look at some of the features of bad software. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h4> Rigidity </h4><br>\n",
    "Rigidity is the tendency of software to be difficult to modify.  Any single modification to a module requires a cascade of subsequent changes in dependent modules. The more modules that need changing, the worse the problem is. One of the symptoms of this is an understimation of the time required to complete a change.  A common refrain heard among programmers, when asked why their estimation was so wrong is, \"It was a lot more complicated than I thought.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4> Fragility </h4><br>\n",
    "Fragility is the tendency of the application code to break in multiple places when a single change is made.  Often times, these problems may occur in modules that don't have any obvious relationship to the module that was changed.  As the module fragility increases, the likelihood of a change causing an unexpected problem approaches certainty. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h4> Immobility </h4><br>\n",
    "A design is immobile when it contains parts that could be re-used in other systems, but the cost, effort and risk of separating them from the original system are too great. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h4> Viscosity </h4><br>\n",
    "When faced with a change, developers often have several ways to implement the desired change. Some ways preserve the design, others do not (they are called hacks). A system has a high viscosity if the design-preserving changes are more difficult to use than the hacks. It’s easy to do the wrong thing and difficult to do the right thing. Apart from viscosity of the software itself, there is also viscosity of the system as a whole. If running unit tests and compilation takes a lot of time, it is likely for a developer to bypass procedures and implement a hack without running all automated tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Needless repetition</h4><br>\n",
    "In short copy and pasting code throughout the system. Usually this happens when necessary abstractions have not been made, either because of a lack of time or a lack of experience. What remains is procedural software. Code may not have been literally copy and pasted but business rules are not implemented in a clear and distinct way.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4> Opacity </h4><br>\n",
    "Opacity is the tendency of a module to be difficult to understand. Code can be written in a clear and expressive manner, or it can be written in an opaque and convoluted way. Code that evolves over time tends to become more difficult to understand over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Needless complexity</h4><br>\n",
    "This may very well be the most important smell of bad design. Developers, in a passionate attempt to avoid the other 6 smells, introduce all sorts of abstractions and preparations for potential changes in the future. Good software design is lightweight, flexible, easy to read and understand and above all easy to change so you don’t have to keep into account all potential changes in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now take a look at the SOLID principles, whose aim is to give developers a guide for avoiding bad software. \n"

    "<h3> The SOLID Principles </h3><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early years of this century, Robert C, Martin, colloquially known as “Uncle Bob”, formulated the common principles of Object Oriented design into a mnemonic termed SOLID. These five principles are as follows: <br>\n",
    "1. S. - Single responsibility principle. An class design should only have one responsibility. Or as Martin puts it: “A class should only have one reason to change”. For example, a Person object should only focus on managing the attributes of a Person, and not, for example, worry about printing the data in a formatted way. This responsibility should lie in another class, for example, a FormattedPrint class. <br><br>\n",
    "2. O. - Open/Closed principle. A class should be open to extension, but never to modification, What this means in principle is that once a class is created, assuming that it is designed correctly, future software updates should never be made to the original class. Instead using inheritance a new class should be derived from the parent with the new functionality encapsulated.<br><br>\n",
    "3. L. - Liskov's Substitution principle.\n",
    "This principle says that any derived class can substitute for its base class without changes. Often this runs counterintuitive to what would seem like common sense. For example, say you had a class Square() that inherits from class Rectangle(). In the real world, a square is a type of rectangle, so this seems to make sense, however, because a square has both the height and the width as identical, setting the height in the square also should set the width as well. This is not true for rectangles. Thus, this design fails the Liskov substitution principle. <br><br>\n",
    "4. I. - Interface/Segregation Principle. This principle dictates that no client should need to know about methods that it won't use. A well known example of this is the experience of Robert Martin at Xerox. Xerox had designed new software to control both printing and stapling. There was a single Job class that had methods for both of these operations. A client that implemented a stapling job had to know about the print methods as well, even though it didn't use them. This made the Job class code grow large and complex, which made it very difficult to maintain. The proper way to implement this with this principle was to have a Print class and a Staple class with methods only relevant for their function. <br><br>\n",
    "5. D. - Dependency/Inversion principle. This principle says that class that high level classes, i.e. classes that do high level logic shouldn't depend on low level classes directly, instead, an abstraction should be created between the. This is also called decoupling. For example, if a class is created that requires a connection to a database, it shouldn't call the database connection class directly. Why? Well, for example, what if the company is using MySQL for its database. Then the high level class would call the low level class that connects to the MySQL database. Why is this a problem? What if the company decides instead to replace MySQL with PostGresSQL? Then the high level class has to be re-written to accomodate the new database. Rather the right approach is to create a new class, DatabaseConnection, which abstracts out the connection. Then, it is a much simpler matter to add a new interface for a PostGresSQL connection than it is to re-write the high level class to handle the new database. <br><br>"

In 1994, the seminal book on design patterns Design Patterns – Elements of Reusable Object Oriented Software” written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides, commonly known as the “gang of four”, was released.

If my_generator had return e rather than yield e, the only value that it would ever return is '1'. However, because we use the yield keyword, every call to the generator using it as an argument to the bultin next() function give us the next element of the list, so the output would be 1 2 3 4 5 rather than just 1 if we had a normal function. Additionally, since x is now iterable, we could also re-write the above code like this: "
